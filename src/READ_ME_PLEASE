Hello and welcome to the greenhouse project.
Thank you so much for taking interest in this assignment.
By the end of this project you should have a system that waters plants, turns on/off grow lights, and takes timelapse video.

We finished most of individual parts of this project, but you need to put it all together.

There are a couple of things you need to get used to using:
1. Python
2. Virtual environments
	a. to activate type: cd /home/Gardener/GreenhousePython/primaryPython
	b. hit enter, then type: source, vir/bin/activate
3. All of your code should be stored in /home/Gardener/GreenhousePython/primaryPython
	a. to use code, activate the virtual environment, then type: python name_of_file.py

For any questions, contact arosas@mcpasd.k12.wi.us

Feel free to redo any of the code, but as it stands:
	tkinter_stuff.py runs the gui and is the center of the code
	sunrise_stuff.py tells the code when to turn on and off grow lights
	mcp_testing.py gets moisture data from the moisture sensor
	water_control.py (may be broken) activates the relay to turn on the pump
	cameraControl.py takes pictures that are stored in a file within /home/Gardener/GreenhousePython/primaryPython
		--> You need to make code that 1. activates cameraControl every hour to take a timelapse amd 2. eventually renders those images into a video

THE HARDEST PART OF THIS ASSIGMENT IS MAKING ALL THE CODE WORK TOGETHER
But once you have it working, assembling should be easier. Note that there is only one relay, so choose to build either the growlight system or the watering system, but not both.

Good luck!
